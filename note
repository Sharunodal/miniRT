The read.c is now integrated to the main function to read an rt file. I will split it according to the norm after making sure it works perfectly. I made test.rt for testing any objects, so just execute:
./miniRT ./test.rt

Since the mandatory .rt files are supposed to create scenes where we see the objects, we can assume that:
right = normal vector 1,0,0
left = -1,0,0
up = 0,1,0
down = 0,-1,0
forward = 0,0,1
backward = 0,0,-1


Process:
-validate
-set up the scene from .rt
-generate 3d objects, light, camera
-set camera position
-calculate if camera ray vector hits the object, and the magnitude of this vector
-calculate colour for the pixel based on the distance
-add ambient light
-add light
-render the scene

What it does currently:
-Initialises the window, can exit by clicking the cross or with esc
-Reads any .rt file and converts the values from there to the mrt struct
-renders a sphere object based on it's coordinates with a simple shading based on the distance
-Calculates the camera rotation

Functions needed:
-Calculate the magnitude of each ray from the camera to a cylinder and pass this value to calculate_colour() in the form of the "t" variable'
-Same for plane
-Handling multiple objects in the scene simultaneously

-Improve ambient light
-Improve light source
